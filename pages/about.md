## History of Emergency Medical Systems (EMS)  
Ambulances first were used mainly in warfare to transport wounded troops off the battlefield to field hospitals to be treated. The first instances of the modern idea of an ambulance began with the Spanish during the reconquista in 1487. In the United States, ambulances were utilized during the American Civil War extensively and were a common sight on battles during the war.

Because of veterans returning home from the war to their civilian lives, there began to be a push for ambulances being used for civilians as they had seen first hand the benefits on the battlefields. The first pre-hospital ambulance service started from Civil War veterans around the country. The first such case was in Cincinnati, Ohio. They used horsedrawn wagons and provided a transport directly to the hospital. These early ambulances did not necessarily have trained medical staff or equipment on board and instead provided a direct transport to the hospital.

With the development of automobiles came the natural progression from horsedrawn to automobile ambulances. These saw widespread usage in both World Wars in which thousands of ambulances were utilized to transport wounded. War was the vehicle through which emergency medicine progressed. During the Korean War, usage of helicopters for medical purposes began. This concept was popularized by the show _M_*A*S*H*.

Finally, the modern emergence of a pre-hospital specialized ambulance service began in the 1970's. Many physicians returned from the Vietnam War with extensive medical experience treating traumatic injuries. Recognizing that there was similar injuries in the US, these physicians pushed for the creation of Emergency Departments at hospitals, which did not exist prior to the 1970s. Knowing that time is critical for many illnesses and injuries in the US, ambulances began to be staffed by trained professionals and carried modern equipment to treat patients. And thus modern EMS was born.
